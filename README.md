# Search twitter feed by profil

This app read form twitter accounts the last 10 post and display on landing page.

To improve the user experience, I added the option to position the form to the top or to the bottom, in case a user wants to screen share, and the position can be changed to clear the way.

## How to install

run:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

## How to run the application

run:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

I treated this test as work from a real client, with most importance and I really loved it.
